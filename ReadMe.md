# Optimal Turn-Right Trajectory using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle

## Description

Small python script that solve the optimization problem to generate the time optimal trajectory given a maximum allowed acceleration, initial and final conditions. It is based on the application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.

#### Trajectories for different initial/final velocities:
